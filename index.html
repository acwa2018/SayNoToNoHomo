		<p>We are a group of high schoolers trying to spread awareness about homophobia in Philadelphia and beyond. In the United States today, we see a lot of division and 
      hate over many differences, for example, race, gender, religion, and sexuality. This country has always strived for progression and greatness in the world and to 
      truly do that we must unify and come together and accept one another for who each and everyone of us are. In order to bring awareness to the issue of homophobia we 
      decided on developing this website. We are going to go over a few topics that correlate with the LGBTQ community in both positive and negative ways, such as Philadelphia, politics, religion, and society.</p>

					<p>Stretching from the Schuylkill to Darby from Girard Estates to Mount Airy the tension of homosexuality and the openness of 
            the idea is about as harsh and dynamic as river rafting the Titanic. We have openly safe community centers such as The Attic, a free space for all people, to "Go Home Homo" riots from Trump supporters against any and all types of people. 
            In schools a common saying before anything is "no homo bro" but one of the best inner city hangouts are within the Gayborhood. Our input and output of opinion flows so rapidly that 
            bypassers are swept up by the rapid changes making their first influence of the topic of homosexuality their final one. People are so bombarded by negative views that they have trouble telling fact from fiction, or just believe the first things and opinions they hear.<p/>
          <p> Being discriminated on who you are and/or what you believe is a shitty feeling but below are some community resources that I personally know as safe places for all people of all types.

					<h3>FADA</h3>
					<p>FADA (First Amendment Defense Act) is an act of legislation that gives organizations and business the right to not surve people who are homosexual based on their religious beliefs. It was first brought to the house by representitive Raul Labrador in 2015. It was not passed and died in the house but recently it has been getting more attention because of President Donald Trumps attorney general pick Jeff Sessions. Sessions a senator supported the bill and this support has been a reason for concern for many groups that supoort LGBT rights. As attorney general Sessions job is to enforce the law and act as the "People's lawyer" for all citizens.</p>
					<h3>Harvey Milk</h3>
					<p>A person who is known for pioneering for gay rights in the realm of politics is a Mr. Harvey Milk. Harvey Milk was the first openly gay politician to be elected to political office. He was elected to the San Fransico Board of Supervisors in 1978. He was born in New York and moved to California in his late 30's. His assasination led to people really rethinking how we treat about gay people in this nation. Harvey Milk will go down as one of the best and first leaders of the gay community.</p>
					<h3>Present Reaction To Gays</h3>
					<p>"There can be no discrimination against gays. Iâ€™m against gay marriage". -President Donald Trump<br>
					If the leader of the free world can be an openly against equal rights how can he expect other Americans to be accepting of people. That's why we as the future of this country must take a strong stance against hatred in our country no matter who leads us. If we the millennials(The generation between 1980-2000)</p>
					<h3>2015 The Year Of Hope</h3>
					<p>There are some positve moments for gay rights as well in politics. In 2015 gay marrige was made legal by the United States Supreme Court and people who were gay were finally able to get married. This was years in the making as gays finally got the rights we all deserve.</p>

				<h2>"NO HOMO BRO!"</h2>
				<p>Has that ever been said to you? What was the situation? Were you and a couple of friends just complimenting eachother and then all of a sudden one of
          them speaks up and says "no homo"? If so, you might recognize situations that are similar to this one where someone says "no homo" for no reason, but to 
          show their manefestation of insecurity involving their sexuality. It's just like the saying "that's so gay" where we ridicule something just because it's
          different so we use homosexuality as an insult and it's negatively perceived by others. When someone says "no homo" it expresses that the sayer does not 
          want to be perceived as homosexual, thus meaning that there is something wrong with being perceived or being homosexual. </p>
